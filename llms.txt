## Core Services

### Spray Insulation (PUR Foam)
Professional closed-cell and open-cell polyurethane spray foam insulation for residential and commercial buildings. The insulation is applied as a liquid that expands on contact, creating a seamless, airtight barrier that eliminates thermal bridges. Key advantages over traditional insulation: no gaps or seams, higher R-value per centimeter, moisture resistance, and long-term dimensional stability.

### Application Areas
- **Crawl spaces (krypgrunder)**: Eliminates drafts, moisture, and cold radiation. PUR foam seals the entire surface seamlessly.
- **Attics and roofs (vindar & tak)**: Minimizes heat loss through difficult flanking points. Ideal for irregularly shaped spaces.
- **Walls (väggar)**: Spray insulation for airtightness, moisture protection, and consistent indoor temperature.
- **Industrial buildings (hallar)**: Large-scale spray insulation of warehouses and commercial properties to reduce operating costs.

### Polyurea Coatings
High-performance protective coatings for waterproofing, abrasion resistance, and chemical protection.

## Technical Background
Polyurethane spray foam technology has been used internationally since the 1950s. The material expands to fill every opening, creating an air- and vapor-tight surface with controlled density — completely seamless. A typical residential crawl space or attic can be insulated in a single day. The material cures in seconds, allowing immediate further work.

## Energy Savings
Spray insulation typically reduces heating costs by 30-50% depending on the building's existing insulation level and construction type. Payback period ranges from 3-7 years based on building size and energy costs.

## Service Area
Primarily Skåne (Scania), southern Sweden. Available for larger projects throughout Sweden and the Nordic region.
